# Boundaries-of-classifiers

To reproduce the evaluations you just have to execute the two commands below on the data whose alignment vectors have already been generated with the embeddings.

** We kindly request you to install the python(>= 3.8) dependencies gradually. **

- Run data on classifiers

  `$ sh ./job_sota.sh`

- Run histogram to draw figures

  `$ sh ./histogram.sh`
